How to change colors:
go to gnome-shell
find gnome-shell.css
Change any colors with the same colors as the colors in shell-link (use ctrl-f and search for shell-link)
and change line 251 with the rgb of your color
USE THE GREEN RICE FOR RERICING AS IT IS ALL ONE COLOR


# Notes:

unless prefixed with "m-" all rices are not owned by me, all credit go to their respectful owners
